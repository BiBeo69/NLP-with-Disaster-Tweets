# Disaster Tweet Classification - Advanced Neural Network Solution

## Model Architecture
The solution employs a hybrid neural network architecture combining transformer and recurrent components with the following structure:

- **Transformer Backbone:** DistilBERT-base-uncased (66M parameters, 6 layers, 768 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads)
- **Sequence Processing:** Bidirectional GRU with 64 units in each direction
- **Attention Mechanism:** Custom learnable attention layer for dynamic feature weighting
- **Classification Head:** Stacked dense layers (128 → 64 → 32 units) with progressive dropout regularization
- **Output Layer:** Single unit with sigmoid activation for binary classification

## Technical Implementation
- **Class Weighting:** Applied weights {0: 0.877, 1: 1.164} to address dataset imbalance
- **Regularization:** Implemented dropout (0.2-0.3 rates) and layer normalization
- **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with initial learning rate 2e-5 and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling
- **Validation Strategy:** 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Early Stopping:** Configured with 2-epoch patience and best weights restoration
